# List Of Things (2017)

## Preable

I have disabled a few things to make this project accessible for viewing by anybody

## Setup

yarn or npm install

You'll need a .env file with some vars set to run this project. If you are keen to get them, just ask

## other things

I'd use TypeScript now - this was made in 2017, things have changed

Also, this was built as a learning project
Zero cares were given about styling in this project. It is styled with pure css
